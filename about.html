      <p class="aboutText" id=aboutOne>Pat the Cookie Chef discovered her secret recipe on a sailing journey through the Norweigan seas with her husband Pete just before the birth of their two children, Paula and Pete, Jr.  Pat and Pete were avid fishers and through their love of the great catch, spent many hours upon their private yacht experimenting with various fish-based culinary delights.  One evening Pete lamented to Pat that he missed the delicious sugar cookies she used to make while they were courting.  Pat wished to surprise Pete- and boy did she!  With an abundance of Salmon and a lack of the typical cookie protein sources (i.e. eggs) aboard their ship, Pat set out to re-invente her famous cookies.  On the cold Norwegian Sea, Pat discovered a healthy and delicious alternative to the typical cookie.</p>

      <p class="aboutText"id="aboutTwo" >As Pat and Pete made their way across the ocean back to their home in Seattle, they shared Pat’s Salmon Cookies with everyone they met.  People were often surprised about the unconventional ingredients but no one ever spit them out.  In fact, Pat began to receive orders from people all over the world asking for her Salmon Cookies.  It wasn’t long before Pat and Pete bought a kitchen and spawned their first storefront at 1st and Pike near Seattle’s famous Pike Place Market.  The location would provide a heaping supply of fresh salmon for their cookies and lines of tourist out the doors.</p>
